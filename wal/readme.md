## wal.go

```go

// Open opens the WAL at the given snap.
// The snap SHOULD have been previously saved to the WAL, or the following
// ReadAll will fail.
// The returned WAL is ready to read and the first record will be the one after
// the given snap. The WAL cannot be appended to before reading out all of its
// previous records.
func Open(lg *zap.Logger, dirpath string, snap walpb.Snapshot) (*WAL, error) {
	w, err := openAtIndex(lg, dirpath, snap, true)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	if w.dirFile, err = fileutil.OpenDir(w.dir); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return w, nil
}

```
